                Hi, I'm Dylan. I'm a 2nd year Computer Science Student 
                at the <span class="emp">University of Cambridge</span>.

                <br><br>
                During the summer of 2018 I was a 
                <span class="emp">Research Intern</span> 
                at the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre. 
                Here I worked on a webscraper,
                CrimeBot, which scraped underground forums to collect 
                posts, and membership details with hope that the dataset
                built from this, CrimeBB, can be used to help Cybercrime
                research. This project was supervised by Sergio Pastrana
                and Richard Clayton.

                <br><br>
                During the summer of 2019 I will be working as a <span class="emp">Software
                Development Intern</span> at Capital One in Nottingham.
